The linear law models combat as one-on-one engagements, where each fighter faces a single opponent—like hoplites or medieval knights. Casualties increase in proportion to the number of direct pairings. Modern warfare differs: machine gunners can engage multiple targets, artillery and drones strike across the battlefield, and tanks concentrate firepower. Because each unit can affect many opponents, attrition grows faster, roughly with the square of force size. Therefore, the square law is used for modern ranged, aimed weapons, while the linear law applies mainly to hand-to-hand or limited-rate weapons.

The following table classifies common weapon and combat system types according to which Lanchester law—linear or square—best approximates their attrition dynamics. It considers effective range, engagement mode, and whether each unit can concentrate fire on multiple targets, providing a practical framework for linking weapon characteristics to attrition modeling.


| Weapon / System                            | Effective Range & Engagement Mode        | Closest Lanchester Law       | Reason                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Melee (sword, spear, bayonet)**          | Contact only, one opponent per fighter   | Linear                       | One-on-one matchups dominate                               |
| **Pistol / revolver / shotgun**            | Very short range, low rate of fire       | Linear (approx)              | Mostly one target at a time                                |
| **Submachine gun**                         | Short range, high fire rate              | Between Linear & Square      | Depends on terrain: one target (indoors) vs. groups (open) |
| **Bolt-action / semi-auto rifles**         | Medium–long range, aimed fire            | Square                       | Each shooter can pick targets across battlefield           |
| **Assault rifle / battle rifle**           | Long range, rapid fire                   | Square                       | Firepower adds across shooters, not just pairwise          |
| **Light / heavy machine gun**              | Sustained fire, area suppression         | Square                       | Can engage multiple enemies simultaneously                 |
| **Anti-tank weapons (RPG, ATGM, bazooka)** | Long range, selective fire               | Square                       | Few operators, each can strike valuable armored units      |
| **Artillery / mortars / rockets**          | Long–very long range, area effects       | Square                       | Concentrated firepower scales with numbers                 |
| **UAVs / armed drones**                    | Wide coverage, multiple possible targets | Square                       | Force size multiplies both sensing and killing power       |
| **Electronic warfare**                     | Non-kinetic, degrades enemy systems      | Neither (modeled separately) | Doesn’t cause attrition but reduces effectiveness          |
